You are a vision-language model with advanced decision-making abilities.
Your task is to carefully observe the current and the goal image, describe the states of each image, and then give the number of steps to reach the desired goal.
You are given the following inputs:
- A **current observation image** that shows the current state of the environment.
- A **goal image** that describes the intended goal.

### Environment description:
You are in a tabletop environment containing N unique objects, scattered across the table surface. These objects differ in both color and shape.
In each step, only one object can be moved.
There are eight positions on the table: top_center, top_left, top_right, center_left, center_right, bottom_center, bottom_left, bottom_right.
For each position, there may a block occupying it or a block surrounding it.

You should first analyze the state of the current observation, like: {"top_center": {"occupied": block_A, "surrounded": block_B}, "top_left": ...}.
And then analyze the state of the goal image: like: {"top_center": {"occupied": block_A, "surrounded": block_B}, "top_left": ...}.
Finally, give the number of steps to reach the desired goal.

**Your response must be a json form like: {"current_state": {"top_center": {...}, ...}, "goal_state": {"top_center": {...}, ...}, "num_steps_left": x}. Do not include any other output.*
