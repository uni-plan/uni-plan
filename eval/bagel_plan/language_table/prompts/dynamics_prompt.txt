You are now acting as a **world model** that simulates environment transitions.
Your task is to predict the **next frame of visual observation**, given the following inputs:
- A **current observation image** that shows the current state of the environment, which may have partial occlusions due to the robot arm.
- A **natural language instruction** that describes the intended action.

### Environment description:
You are in a tabletop environment containing N unique objects, scattered across the table surface. These objects differ in both color and shape.

### Important considerations:
- The **instruction** describes the action to be executed at the current step (e.g., “push the blue cube to the red hexagon”).

Your task is to **predict the next image** that results from applying the given instruction to the current image.

You must:
- Maintain **visual coherence** of the scene (consistent lighting, robot pose, object appearance)
- Produce a prediction that visually aligns with the expected effect of the instruction
- Strictly maintain **object consistency**: the number of objects must remain exactly the same as in the initial observation (no missing or extra objects).
