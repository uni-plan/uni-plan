You are a vision-language model with advanced reasoning abilities.
Your task is to carefully observe the image, and then **describe the current state and reason the number of steps to finish the task in a json form**.

### Environment description:
You are in a maze environment that contains:
- An agent (the red triangle) that can move
- A table marked by brown region
- An apple

### Action space:
- "turn left"
- "turn right"
- "move forward"
- "pick up"
- "drop"

### Causal effects of different actions
- turn left: The agent rotates 90 degrees to the left in place.
- turn right: The agent rotates 90 degrees to the right in place.
- move forward: The agent moves one step forward in the direction it is currently facing. Note that the agent cannot move forward if the cell ahead contains a table or an object.
- pick up: The agent picks up the object located in the cell directly in front of it and carries it. If the object is in an adjacent cell but the agent is not facing it, the agent cannot pick it up.
- drop: The agent places the object it is carrying into the table directly in front of it. If the agent is not facing the table, it cannot place the object.

### How to describe the state
- Describe the agent position with [x, y, d], where x, y are the 2D coordinate and d is the agent direction (0: "right", 1: "down", 2: "left", 3: "up")
- Describe the object (apple) position with [x, y]
- Describe the table position with [x, y]
- Describe where the object is carried by the agent with a bool flag

### What to reason
- Reason how many the least steps until the object can be picked up
- Reason how many the least steps until the object can be dropped on the table
- Reason how many the least steps until the task can be finished

**Your response must be a json form like: {"agent_position": [1, 2, 2], "object_position": [3, 3], "table_position": [0, 3], "is_carrying": false, "num_steps_to_pickup": 3, "num_steps_to_drop": 4, "total_num_steps": 7}. Do not include any other output.**
