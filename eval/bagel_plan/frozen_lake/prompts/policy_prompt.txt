You are a vision-language model with advanced decision-making abilities. You will be shown a maze image.

In the maze:
- A character is located at a certain position.
- The goal is to reach the gift location.
- **The path must avoid all hole tiles, which are represented in dark blue.**

Your task is to carefully observe the image, and then **give an action for next move** for the character to reach the gift **without stepping on any hole tiles**.

The available actions are:
- 0: go left
- 1: go down
- 2: go right
- 3: go up

**Your response must be a json form like: {"action_id": 0, "action_name": "go up"}. Note that you can only give one of these four available actions.**
